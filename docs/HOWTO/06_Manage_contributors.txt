                        MANAGE CONTRIBUTORS - HOWTO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  The owner/author of a document can choose to share the document with other 
    users who can then view and edit content of the document. These additional 
    users are called collaborators in LEOS.

2.  If a user is owner of a document, once the document is opened, a +" icon is
    available next to the Collaborators title to add users.  

3.  To add a collaborator, click on the  '+' icon. Type the beginning of the
    collaborator name then click on it in the displayed result. 
    
4.  Choose his role in the drop list next to his name . Possibility are owner 
    (can give ownership and edit) and collaborator (can only edit).

5.  Click on the small "V" to save your choice or "X" to cancel.
    If saved, the users will be added to the list of collaborators and will be 
    visible below the 'Collaborators' title. Now, this document will be available 
    in repository browser to all the collaborators and owners for viewing and editing.
   
4.  To remove an existing contributor, click on the small '-' icon after the
    collaborator's name. The user will be removed from the list of collaborators 
    of the document and hence will not be able to view or edit the document.
