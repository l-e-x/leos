	created.
	
2.  A user can decide to create a major version to reflect a particular
    status/evolution of the document.

    as major version' button on the top left of the document pane.

    an input field for a version comment.

6.  Clicking on 'Save' will create a new major version with the version comment
	as meta data and close the dialog

7.  Clicking on 'Close' will cancel your action and close the dialog
