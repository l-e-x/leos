The declaration also called for introducing a supplementary non-risk based measure to contain the build-up of leverage in the banking system, and developing a framework for stronger liquidity buffers. In response to the mandate given by the G20, in September 2009 the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), agreed on a number of measures to strengthen the regulation of the banking sector. These measures were endorsed by the G20 leaders at their Pittsburgh Summit of 24-25 September 2009 and were set out in detail in December 2009. In July and September 2010, GHOS issued two further announcements on design and calibration of these new measures, and in December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) published the final measures, that are referred to as Basel III.</u>

This results in divergences between national rules which are such as to obstruct the fundamental freedoms and thus have a direct effect on the functioning of the internal market and cause significant distortions of competition. In particular, such divergences hamper the cross-border provision of services and the establishment in other Member since each time different rules have to be assessed and complied with by operators when doing business in another Member State. In addition, credit institutions and investment firms authorized in different Member States are often subject to different requirements, leading to significant distortions of competition. Divergent development of national laws creates potential and actual obstacles to the smooth functioning of the internal market due to unequal conditions of operation and difficulties for credit institutions and investment firms operating in different juridical systems across the Union. </u>

Such retention should be applicable in all situations where the economic substance of a securitisation is applicable, whatever legal structures or instruments are used to obtain this economic substance.

Purchased receivables should not be subject to the retention requirement if they arise from corporate activity where they are transferred or sold at a discount to finance such activity.

In the latter situation, a pool- specific liquidity facility should generally not be considered a re-securitisation exposure because it represents a tranche of a single asset pool (that is, the applicable pool of whole loans) which contains no securitisation exposures. By contrast, a programme-wide credit enhancement covering only some of the losses above the seller-provided protection across the various pools generally would constitute a tranching of the risk of a pool of multiple assets containing at least one securitisation exposure, and would therefore be a re-securitisation exposure. Nevertheless, if such a programme funds itself entirely with a single class of commercial paper, and if either the programme-wide credit enhancement is not a re-securitisation or the commercial paper is fully supported by the sponsoring credit institution or investment firm, leaving the commercial paper investor effectively exposed to the default risk of the sponsor instead of the underlying pools or assets, then that commercial paper generally should not be considered a re-securitisation exposure.</p>

Thus a long interest-rate futures position shall be treated as a combination of a borrowing maturing on the delivery date of the futures contract and a holding of an asset with maturity date equal to that of the instrument or notional position underlying the futures contract in question. Similarly a sold FRA will be treated as a long position with a maturity date equal to the settlement date plus the contract period, and a short position with maturity equal to the settlement date. Both the borrowing and the asset holding shall be included in the first category set out in Table 1 in Article 325 in order to calculate the own funds requirement for specific risk for interest-rate futures and FRAs. A forward commitment to buy a debt instrument shall be treated as a combination of a borrowing maturing on the delivery date and a long (spot) position in the debt instrument itself. The borrowing shall be included in the first category set out in Table 1 in Article 325 for purposes of specific risk, and the debt instrument under whichever column is appropriate for it in the same table.</p>
