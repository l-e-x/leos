// Mixin for targeting icomoon fonts. This keeps the class namespace in one
// place rather than spreading it through individual files.
// NOTE: If you want to target a specific icon in a component give it a
// distinct class name rather than using the icon class.
//
// Usage:
//
//  .my-element {
//    @include icons {
//      color: red; // Make any icon red.
//    }
//  }
@mixin icons {
  [class^="h-icon-"], [class*=" h-icon-"] {
    @content;
  }
}
